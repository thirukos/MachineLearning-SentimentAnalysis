89,2022-09-08 20:35:37+00:00,@Alexcar26357873 Apologies. Britain has been changing monarch for a thousand years but these days the monarchy’s economic and political power is very limited. The chances of it affecting Sterling are not zero but the Bank of England for example has substantially more power to move the Pound.
